Ever wondered how businesses decide which vendors to promote or drop?
I tackled this in my latest project: Vendor Performance Analysis ðŸ“ˆ
ðŸ’¡ What I did:
Connected to an SQLite database of vendor sales.
Ran deep Exploratory Data Analysis using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.
Discovered which vendors bring in the most value.
Found some brands that are highly profitable but arenâ€™t selling well â€” a goldmine for smart marketing! ðŸ’°
Validated patterns using statistical tests (t-test) to separate facts from noise.
ðŸ”§ Tools I used: SQLite + Python (Pandas, Seaborn, SciPy, Matplotlib)
Let me know what you think â€” or if youâ€™d like to collaborate on a similar project!
